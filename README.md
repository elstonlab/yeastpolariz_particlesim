# yeastpolariz_particlesim

## Overview
Contains data and code necessary to render figures from the main text in Pablo M, Ramirez SA, Elston TC. <i>Particle-based Simulations of Polarity Establishment Reveal Stochastic Promotion of Turing Pattern Formation</i>. PLoS Comp Bio. Accepted, <b>2018</b>


## Compatibility
The scripts to render the figures were tested on a Windows system running MATLAB 2016b. If you do not have MATLAB, you can use free tools such as Python (e.g., via `scipy.io.loadmat`) to import and reformat the data.
