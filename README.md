# yeastpolariz_particlesim

## Overview
Contains data and code necessary to render figures from the main text in Pablo M, Ramirez SA, Elston TC (2018) [Particle-based Simulations of Polarity Establishment Reveal Stochastic Promotion of Turing Pattern Formation](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006016). PLoS Comput Biol. 14(3): e1006016.


## Compatibility
The scripts to render the figures were tested on a Windows system running MATLAB 2016b. If you do not have MATLAB, you can use free tools such as Python (e.g., via `scipy.io.loadmat`) to import and reformat the data.
